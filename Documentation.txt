Auction Platform Backend â€“ Documentation & Best Practices

Tech Stack & Main Libraries
- Node.js + TypeScript: Strong typing, maintainability, and scalability.
- Express.js: REST API framework.
- MongoDB + Mongoose: NoSQL database with schema validation.
- Stripe: Payment processing, customer wallets, and payouts (Stripe Connect).
- Socket.io: Real-time chat and reactions.
- Joi: Request validation.
- http-status-codes: Standardized HTTP status codes.
- node-cron: Background job scheduling.
- express-async-errors: Async error handling middleware.

Project Structure & Key Modules
- src/controllers/: Business logic for products, bids, chat, authentication, payments, and reactions.
- src/models/: Mongoose schemas for User, Product, Bid, Chat, Reaction.
- src/routes/: Express routers for each resource.
- src/middlewares/: Authentication, role-based access, validation, and error handling.
- src/services/stripeService.ts: Stripe API integration.
- src/socket/: Socket.io server setup and event handling.
- src/jobs/: Background jobs (e.g., bidChecker for ending auctions).
- src/config/: Centralized environment and DB config.
- src/utils/: Response helpers and validation utilities.

Key Features & Approaches
1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-based access control (admin/user) via middleware.
- Type-safe user extraction from requests.

2. Product & Auction Management
- Products can be listed, created, and associated with a creator (userId).
- Auctions have a lastBidTime and a bidEnded boolean for state management.
- Stripe product and price are created for each product.

3. Bidding System
- Bids are placed with validation (no duplicate bids, owner cannot bid, must be higher than last bid).
- Background job (bidChecker) automatically ends auctions, finds the top bidder, and processes payment.

4. Payment Processing (Stripe)
- Users save payment methods via Stripe Elements; backend stores the payment method ID.
- When an auction ends, the top bidder is charged using their saved payment method.
- Funds are transferred to the seller using Stripe Connect (requires seller to have a connected account).
- All payment actions are secure and PCI-compliant (no raw card data stored).

5. Real-Time Chat & Reactions
- Socket.io enables real-time chat and message reactions per product.
- Users join product-specific rooms for targeted updates.
- All chat and reaction events are broadcast to relevant users.

6. Validation & Error Handling
- Joi schemas validate all incoming requests.
- Centralized error handler middleware for consistent error responses.
- express-async-errors ensures async errors are caught and handled.

7. Background Jobs
- bidChecker runs on a schedule to process ended auctions, select winners, and handle payments.
- Jobs are automated and run with the app.

8. API Testing & Documentation
- All endpoints are testable via Postman (collection provided).
- Sample request bodies and curl commands are documented for easy testing.

Best Practices Used
- Type Safety: TypeScript throughout, including custom types for Express Request.
- Separation of Concerns: Controllers, routes, models, and services are modular.
- DRY Principle: Shared validation and error handling logic.
- Security: No sensitive data (like card numbers) is stored; Stripe handles all PCI compliance.
- Scalability: Real-time features and background jobs are decoupled from main request flow.
- Maintainability: Centralized config, clear folder structure, and concise comments.

How the Main Flows Work
User Registration & Auth
- User signs up, Stripe customer is created, JWT is issued.
- Authenticated routes require a valid JWT.

Product & Auction
- Users create products (optionally as auctions).
- Auctions have a set end time (lastBidTime).

Bidding
- Users place bids; validation ensures only valid bids are accepted.
- When auction ends, bidChecker finds the top bid and processes payment.

Payment
- Users save payment methods via Stripe Elements.
- On auction end, backend charges the winner and pays out to the seller.

Chat & Reactions
- Real-time chat and reactions via Socket.io.
- All chat and reaction data is also persisted in MongoDB.

API Testing
- All endpoints are documented and testable via Postman and curl.

How to Extend or Maintain
- Add new features by creating new controllers and routes.
- Add new background jobs in src/jobs/.
- Update validation schemas in src/validators/.
- Use the provided Postman collection for API testing.

This project follows industry best practices for a modern, secure, and scalable auction platform backend.
